This makes a FUCKTON of chili so unless you're serious about this chili and want to be eating it for the next several days, you may want to consider halving the ingredients where it makes sense to do so. The only exception here is for the onion and the poblano and the garlic. That's just because I hate using half of a single piece of fresh produce while the other half rots.  

###### INGREDIENTS
- 2 pounds beef, pork, or whatever tf you want in 1 inch cubes (beef chuck or sirloin is ideal).  
- 2 pounds extra lean ground beef (or whatever other ground meat you want).  
- A whole fucking bulb of garlic. Don't skimp on the garlic.  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped.  
- 1 poblano pepper, diced.  
- 2 Red Bell Peppers  
- 2 jalapeno peppers, diced. Keep the seeds for extra spiciness, discard them for a more mild chili.
- Beer. Get a 6 pack of your absolute favorite beer. You will need more or less of this depending on how much chili you are making and how thick / thin you like your chili.  
- 4 cans red kidney beans, preferably dark but tbh you can substitute your favorite bean here and it will still work.  
- 2 cans diced tomatoes.  
- 2 cans tomato paste.  

###### SPICES
- 4 tbsp beef stock. I prefer Better Than Bouillon Beef  
- 2 tbsp dried oregano.  
- 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder.  
- 2 tsp AP flour.  
- 2 tbsp cumin.  
- 4 tbsp paprika.  
- 8 tbsp chili powder.  
- 2 tbsp ground cayenne pepper + more to taste.  
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon.  

###### STEPS
1. Cube and brown the meat. If it is beef, only brown it don't cook it all the way. If it is pork or poultry cook it just slightly longer. Cook the ground meat slightly longer than is necessary to brown it. Set all the meat aside.  
2. Dice the onions, garlic, peppers. Open up all of the canned goods you're going to need to open now.  
3. Add all the spices into a bowl. Note, there is no salt or black pepper in this recipe. It doesn't need it.  
4. In the same pot that you will be stewing the chili in, heat the oil over medium heat to around 375F. I recommend avocado oil or at least grapeseed oil for this.  
5. Add diced onions and garlic, stir for 1 minute, then add all the meat you prepared in step 1.
6. Add diced pepper and jalapeno and let it cook for a bit.  
7. Add 1 12 oz can of beer for now, this is the least you will need even if you are doing a half recipe.  
8. Throw all the spices into the pot and stir to make sure this is very evenly distributed.  
9. Allow chili to come to a boil, then add beans, tomatoes, paste. By "boil" here I don't literally mean a full boil with your stove burners on high heat, just that the chili is kinda bubbling a little bit.
10. At this point, your chili will be noticeably thicker than it was after you added the beer in step 7, this is your chance to add more beer if the chili seems too thick. You don't want it too thick, you also don't want it too thin. Add enough beer so that the chili's consistency is correct in your judgment and drink the rest.  
11. Bring back to a boil, again not a full rolling boil like you're boiling pasta, just bubbling a little bit. Lower heat to about the lowest setting on your burner that isn't "keep warm" or "low", put a lid of some kind on the pot and simmer over low heat for 1 hour.
